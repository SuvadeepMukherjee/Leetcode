## Nodes and graphs

- Trees and graphs are abstract data structures that show up everywhere in both the physical world and the software world 
- Node is an abstract data type with 2 things .First a node stores data.This data can be whatever we want - an integer , a boolean , a hash map , our own custom objects or all the above .Second a node stores pointers to other nodes 
- Graph is a collection of nodes and their pointers to other nodes .Linked lists and trees are both types of graphs
- Even though tree is a type of graph , trees and graphs are considered seperate topics

### Tree
