# Chap 3 | Python Numbers

## Basic Data Types 

------

The Basic Data Types in Python are 

- Strings
- Integers
- Booleans
- Floats

## All Data Types

------

All Data Types in Python are the following 

-  Strings
- Integers
- Frozenset
- Booleans
- Floats
- Bytes
- Dictionary
- Complex
- Range
- List
- Tuple
- Set

## Integers

------

- Whole numbers only
- Positive or Negative
- No Decimal Points
- They can be as large as we want 

Note ➡️ 

- 1_000 ➡️ 1,000
- 09 ➡️ Leading Zeros in decimal integer literals are not permitted

##  Floats

------

- Written with a Decimal Point
- Positive or negative
- They can not be as large as we want 

Note ➡️

- 1_000.5 ➡️ 1,000.5
- 1.289e+19 (Scientific Number)

## Operators

------

+ Addition
  + `+` ➡️ `1+1 ➡️ 2`
+ Substraction
  + `-` ➡️ `3-2` ➡️ 1
+ Division
  + `10/3 ➡️ 3.3333`
+ Multiplication
  + `10*3 ➡️ 30`
+ Integer Division `//` ➡️ Rounds Down
  + `10//3 ➡️ 3`, `10//-3 ➡️ -4`
+ Exponentiation `**`
  + `4 **3 ➡️ 4*4*4`
+ Module `%`
  + `10 % 3 ➡️ 1`

Note ➡️

+ Whenever there is float involved the answer is a float ➡️ `4 - 3.0 ➡️ 1.0`
